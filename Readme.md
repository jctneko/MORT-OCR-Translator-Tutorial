Tip:
- You may have to adjust your game dialogue opacity to 100% for better OCR result.
- You can setting the Text to speech by toggling the 'TTS' option in the settings.

## Pick Dialogue font color for Better result

## Using with DeepL
1. If you prefer to use DeepL for translation, ensure that the status is 'available'.

2. The process chain would look like this: screen -> windows OCR -> MORT -> Edge (background) -> result
3. DeepL requires the Edge browser to work in the background.
4. You can run the game with any browser, because it just captures the screen.

## Troubleshooting
1. Check the [System Requirement](https://github.com/killkimno/MORT#system-requirement)
2. If MORT is not capturing the text, check the settings and ensure the software is set to your specific browser.

3. If you are still having trouble, you can change the OCR engine to a different one under the OCR settings.

Remember, this is an open-source tool that is continually being updated. Please report any issues or suggestions to the developers via the GitHub page. This tool is a great way to get real-time translations for games or other applications that do not have built-in translations.
